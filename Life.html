    <h2 style="color: navy;">School:</h2>
    <p>I completed my matriculation and intermediate from <b>Dhanbad Public School</b> which is located in Dhanbad, Jharkhand. It is situated near Dhangi mountain in Dhanbad. My highest achievement was securing 10 <small>CGPA</small> in 10<sup>th</sup> Boards. I made lot of friends here who always helped and supported me to do the best. All the etiquettes and morals were taught by my great teachers which is a great teaching for life. Spending 12 years in this school was really very nostalgic and memorable at the same time. </p>

    <p>I graduated from <strong>KNS Institute of Technology</strong>, Bangalore in the year 2023 with a degree of B.E. in Computer Science. My aggregate is <sub>8.4</sub> CGPA <small>CGPA</small>.
